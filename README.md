Why we need Operating System?
We have one program created in some language like phyton or php,... and you want to run this program you need the operating system. Without operating system it is impossible to run the program. But if you want to run or boot the operating system we need the RAM and CPU. Without RAM and CPU you wont able to boot the operating system. If you want to install the operating system you need the HardDisk. HardDisk is typically known as Storage. (Storage is permanent, For temporary memory (RAM) is used). Typically RAM and CPU is known as Compute or Compute Unit. But if you want, data needs to store some data permanently (OS is store permanent after reboot also it doesn't remove)we need HardDisk typically known as storage or Storage Unit. If you want to run the program, sometimes program is also known as services. For example. one of the name of the service called as Web service, because you want to launch a website or App service, If you want to launch some app of java or python, etc... If you want to launch a program called Database Services you need the Operating System. For Operating system you need Compute Unit and Storage Unit. We need it so we need to purchase it as these are the devices invest your money to run the program.
We have a Developer team and they deveoped a Website, Application, Database ,... we need to host our website for customers. (We have a client in the internet and we want the client to visit the website for example, ecommerece website.
To launch a website you need a hardware. This hardware needs to be purchase, we require real public IP, we real internet connectivity, firewall, network devices, we need to hire a technical guy, databases team, IT involment, all we have to invest.

Now there are more thirdparty now a days more than decade. Now we dont want to invest upfront in our IT infrastructure. I dont want to hire some guys who manage by Operating system, Databases, My Security, My firewall, My network, My Ram, CPU. I don't want to purchase these items. There are lot od companies in the market who are doing business for us. Companies are called as Service Providers. They provided services to us. Companies are known as providers and they are providing services. So they are called as Service Providers.

What are the services: If we go and ask provide the RAM and CPU. Yes they will provide us compute. Typically they use a term called compute as a service and they will provide. Don't need to give upfront amount. For example, for this compute unit if you purchase in real world it might cost 1000$. But here you need to pay anything as we don't no how much we are going to utilize more or less. This company work on a model for us and the model is called custome model (Pay as you go). As much you use, you have you pay. Depends on which service you need if you need RAM and CPU, ask we need compute service. If you need storage , It is storage as a service. We have some many like network a service , container service, Kubernetes service, Firewall as a service, Docker as a service, Function as a service, Machine learning a services. 

Previously called as Service Providers. Now a days we use a term called Cloud computing.

Different types of Cloud Computing:
Public Cloud
Private Cloud
Hybrid Cloud.

Anyone can use it, it is public cloud
AWs from Amazon , Azure from Microsoft, Google Cloud Platform(GCP) is a product from Google. It is offering us a public cloud. It means anyone after create a account in platform as a indidivual or any other company can use the computing power of Google.

RAM and CPU, Harddisk, Networking are called as Resources.
Google Compute Engine
